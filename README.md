# Spicetify Private
Custom theme for Spicetify.
My goal was to make it look good on small (5.5 inch) screen.


Install spicetify and run those commands to install theme
```
spicetify --help
git clone git@github.com:tmakuch/SpicetifyPrivate.git %appdata%/spicetify/Themes/SpicetifyPrivate
spicetify backup
spicetify config current_theme SpicetifyPrivate
spicetify config color_scheme dark
spicetify apply
```
